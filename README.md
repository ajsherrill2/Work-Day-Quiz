# <Work-Day-Schedular>

## Description

In this project I was tasked with using third-party API's such as, Bootstrap and jQuery to add styles and functions to complete an unfinished work day schedular application. I built this project so that employees can add important events to a daily planner in order to manage their time more effectively. This project solves the issue of keeping track of the time by color coding each hour of the work day and saving events in the schedule that will not be erased if the employee leaves the page.

## Usage

You can find the new live application at https://ajsherrill2.github.io/Work-Day-Quiz/

Upon opening the Work Day Scheduler application the user will be presented with a planner showing 9 time blocks ranging from 9am to 5pm. Depending on the current time of day relative time blocks will either appear as gray if that time has already past, red for the current hour, and green for any time blocks in the future. An additional  feature within this application is the ability to save events typed into each text area by clicking on its respective save button, this feature saves the text so that if the user leaves this page and then eants to check their planner later the text saved will remain unless later changed by the user.

## Test

Test this application by saving a message within a text area using the respective save button, then refreshing the page or closing and reopening the application and insuring that you saved message is still with the correct time block.

Test time-blocks color coding by seeing if the red time-block matches the live time within the header of the application.
